# TatvaSoft--Internship
During my internship, I am learning PostgreSQL, a popular database system. I am starting with basic SQL and moving to advanced topics. I am learning how to use commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to manage data.

I am also studying important concepts like subqueries, which let me run a query inside another query, and joins, which help combine data from different tables. I am learning about INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and other types of joins. This experience is helping me understand how to work with databases and improve my skills in managing data effectively.
