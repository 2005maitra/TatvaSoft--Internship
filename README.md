# TatvaSoft--Internship
During the  internship, I gained hands-on experience with Angular 14 for frontend development, PostgreSQL with pgAdmin for database management, and .NET 8 with Visual Studio 2022 for backend development. This experience enhanced my understanding of full-stack web application development using modern tools and frameworks in a professional, remote environment.
